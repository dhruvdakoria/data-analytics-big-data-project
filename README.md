## Objective

In this project, your primary task is to apply these 2 approaches to a larger scale data classification task. In doing so, you
will choose a single data set which you will classify with each approach. The data set must have greater than a thousand
labeled examples. These examples must be classified into one of two classes. Note that it is possible to find a large data
set which has more than two classes from which you could always select examples from only two of the classes. If a dataset
contains mixed data (numeric and other types) you can always simply ignore the non-numeric data.
Once the data set has been classified, your job is to compare the results from the classifiers that you chose. The
comparison (in general – details will follow below) must include the following analyses:
• Computational Times for both training and testing
• A confusion matrix
